My First Repository

Hello World! My name is Isaiah and I'm currently going to a community college to earn my prerequisites for International Business. It wasn't always peachy for me. When I was first enrolled in school I wasn't completely sure what I wanted to do. This caused me to waste some time in other programs such as Surgical Technology.

I'm passionate about learning and hope to someday teach and empower people of less fortunate nations to have an equil opportunity. In addition to learning very important skills for the future such as programming and Web Development, I hope to learn the Business Management needed to lead, empower, and teach individuals useful skills and ethics in the future.

Happy Coding!
